# Edge-detection-and-Hough-transform

## A C++ program exploiting OpenCV was written and it contains the following tasks:

* Generated the edge map with the Canny algorithm.
* Used the image generated in the previous step as input for the standard Hough transform (cv::HoughLines() function).
* Colors in green the pixels belonging to the round street signs. The function to compute the circles is cv::HoughCircles().

## Output Image
